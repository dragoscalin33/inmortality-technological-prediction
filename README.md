Data Science Project: Predicting Technological Milestones
This project applies Machine Learning to analyze and predict the future of technology by modeling historical growth trends.

<br>

Project Overview
The core idea is that technological progress follows an exponential curve, which can be modeled using data science to project when key milestones might be reached. This project serves as a compelling portfolio piece to demonstrate skills in data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

Methodology
I trained three separate regression models, each using a verified, real-world dataset of a key technological metric:

Computing Power: Based on data from TOP500.org, which tracks the world's most powerful supercomputers.

Genome Sequencing Cost: Based on data from the National Human Genome Research Institute.

Transistor Density: Based on Moore's Law, a historical observation of transistor growth.

To accurately model the exponential growth, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the data, allowing a linear model to capture the non-linear trend effectively.

Results and Conclusions
The predictions from each model are as follows:

Computing Power: The model predicts a milestone of 10¹² TFLOPS in the year [Insert result from your code].

Genome Sequencing Cost: The model predicts a cost of $1 in the year [Insert result from your code].

Transistor Density: The model predicts 1 billion transistors per chip in the year [Insert result from your code].

The variability in the predictions highlights the complexity of forecasting such a multifaceted event. However, the consistency of the exponential trends across different metrics validates the use of ML to project the future. This analysis serves as a compelling demonstration of how Data Science can be used to make data-driven predictions about complex, long-term trends.
