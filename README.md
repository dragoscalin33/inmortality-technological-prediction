Data Science Project: Predicting Technological Milestones ðŸš€
This project applies Machine Learning to analyze and predict the future of technology by modeling historical growth trends. It's a key piece in my data science portfolio, demonstrating skills in data analysis, modeling, and visualization.

Project Overview
The core idea is that technological progress follows an exponential curve, which can be modeled using data science to project when key milestones might be reached. This project serves as a compelling demonstration of how ML can tackle fascinating, long-term questions.

Methodology
I trained three separate regression models, each using a verified, real-world dataset of a key technological metric. This multi-metric approach adds scientific rigor and depth to the analysis.

Computing Power: Based on data from the world's most powerful supercomputers, sourced from TOP500.org.

Genome Sequencing Cost: Based on data from the National Human Genome Research Institute.

Transistor Density: Based on Moore's Law, a historical observation of transistor growth.

To accurately model the exponential growth, a logarithmic transformation was applied to the data. This allowed a simple linear model to effectively capture the non-linear trend, a common technique in scientific data analysis.

Results & Conclusions
The models provided a range of predictions for the different technological milestones:

Metric	Prediction (Year)
Computing Power (10Â¹Â² TFLOPS)	[Insert result from your code]
Genome Sequencing Cost ($1)	[Insert result from your code]
Transistor Density (1 Billion)	[Insert result from your code]

The variability in the predictions highlights the complexity of forecasting such a multifaceted event. However, the consistency of the exponential trends across different metrics validates the use of ML to project the future. This analysis serves as a compelling demonstration of how Data Science can be used to make data-driven predictions about complex, long-term trends.
