# Data Science Project: Predicting Technological Milestones 🚀

This project applies **Machine Learning** to analyze and predict the future of technology by modeling **historical growth trends**.  
It’s part of my **Data Science portfolio**, showcasing skills in **data analysis, modeling, and visualization**.  

---

## 📌 Project Overview
The core idea is that **technological progress follows an exponential curve**, which can be modeled using Data Science to project when key milestones might be reached.  

This project serves as a **compelling demonstration** of how ML can tackle fascinating, long-term questions.

---

## 🧪 Methodology
I trained **three regression models**, each using a verified, real-world dataset of a key technological metric.  
This **multi-metric approach** adds scientific rigor and depth to the analysis:

- **Computing Power** ⚡  
  Based on data from the world's most powerful supercomputers (sourced from [TOP500.org](https://www.top500.org))  

- **Genome Sequencing Cost** 🧬  
  Data from the [National Human Genome Research Institute](https://www.genome.gov)  

- **Transistor Density (Moore’s Law)** 🔬  
  Historical observation of transistor growth  

👉 To accurately model exponential growth, I applied a **logarithmic transformation** to the data.  
This allowed a **simple linear model** to effectively capture the non-linear trend, a common technique in scientific data analysis.

## 📊 Results & Conclusions
The models provided a range of predictions for different technological milestones:

| Metric                     | Prediction (Year) |
|----------------------------|-------------------|
| Computing Power (10¹² TFLOPS) | [Insert result] |
| Genome Sequencing Cost ($1)   | [Insert result] |
| Transistor Density (1 Billion) | [Insert result] |

✨ Key insights:  
- The **variability** in predictions highlights the complexity of forecasting multifaceted events.  
- The **consistency of exponential trends** across different metrics validates ML for projecting the future.  
- This analysis shows how **Data Science can provide data-driven insights** into complex, long-term trends.
